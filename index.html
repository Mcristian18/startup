      <p class="profile-des">I am an enthusiast and am currently learning web development, starting with html and css. I want to build web site and
      web apps<br> in order to serve other people to make their experience fun and thrilling. Through various courses I hope I can learn<br>
      and grasped a lot about web development. I believe that someday I will become a web developer.</p>

        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>I learned these markup languages during my high school years. As we understood and learned this lesson,
        we were challenged to build a personal website. Fortunately, I was able to pass and get decent remarks.</p>

        <h3>Billiards</h3>
        <p>We know that during lockdown, most of us were bored and we were stuck in our homes due to the rise of Covid-19. One thing
        that helps my boredom is playing online games like 8 ball pool. At that point, I was able to get money and learn this skill as well.</p>
